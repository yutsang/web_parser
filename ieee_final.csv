In the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases, overuse of antibiotics may lead to not only bacterial resistance to antibiotics but also dysbiosis of beneficial bacteria which are essential for maintaining normal human life activities. Instead, phage therapy, which invades and lyses specific pathogenic bacteria without affecting beneficial bacteria, becomes more and more popular to treat bacterial infectious diseases. For the effective phage therapy, it requires to accurately predict potential phage-host interactions from heterogeneous information network consisting of bacteria and phages. Although many models have been proposed for predicting phage-host interactions, most methods fail to consider fully the sparsity and unconnectedness of phage-host heterogeneous information network, deriving the undesirable performance on phage-host interactions prediction. To address the challenge, we propose an effective model called GERMAN-PHI for predicting Phage-Host Interactions via Graph Embedding Representation learning with Multi-head Attention mechaNism. In GERMAN-PHI, the multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to learn representations of phages and hosts from multiple perspectives of phage-host associations, addressing the sparsity and unconnectedness in phage-host heterogeneous information network. More specifically, a module of GAT with talking-heads is employed to learn representations of phages and bacteria, on which neural induction matrix completion is conducted to reconstruct the phage-host association matrix. Results of comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GERMAN-PHI performs better than the state-of-the-art methods on phage-host interactions prediction. In addition, results of case study for two high-risk human pathogens show that GERMAN-PHI can predict validated phages with high accuracy, and some potential or new associated phages are provided as well."

Understanding the forces that drive the dynamics of adaptive evolution is a goal of many sub-fields and applications of evolutionary biology, including in evolutionary computation. The fitness landscape analogy has served as a useful abstraction for addressing these topics across many systems, and recent treatments have revealed how different environments can frame the particulars of adaptive evolution by changing the topography of fitness landscapes. In this study, we examine how the larger, ambient genetic context in which a protein is embedded affects fitness landscape topography and subsequent evolution. Using simulations on empirical fitness landscapes, we discover that the genetic background - genetic variability in regions outside of the locus under study (in this case, an essential bacterial enzyme target of antibiotics) - influences the speed and direction of evolution in several surprising ways. These findings have implications for how we study the evolution of drug resistance in nature, and for presumptions about how biological evolution might be expected to occur in genetically-modified organisms. More generally, the findings speak to theory surrounding how “difference can beget difference” in adaptive evolution (whether biological, computational, or technological): that small differences in environmental or genetic background can greatly alter the specifics of how evolution occurs, which can rapidly drive even slightly diverged populations further apart."

The abuse of traditional antibiotics has led to increased resistance of bacteria and viruses. Efficient therapeutic peptide prediction is critical for peptide drug discovery. However, most of the existing methods only make effective predictions for one class of therapeutic peptides. It is worth noting that currently no predictive method considers sequence length information as a distinct feature of therapeutic peptides. In this article, a novel deep learning approach with matrix factorization for predicting therapeutic peptides (DeepTPpred) by integrating length information are proposed. The matrix factorization layer can learn the potential features of the encoded sequence through the mechanism of first compression and then restoration. And the length features of the sequence of therapeutic peptides are embedded with encoded amino acid sequences. To automatically learn therapeutic peptide predictions, these latent features are input into the neural networks with self-attention mechanism. On eight therapeutic peptide datasets, DeepTPpred achieved excellent prediction results. Based on these datasets, we first integrated eight datasets to obtain a full therapeutic peptide integration dataset. Then, we obtained two functional integration datasets based on the functional similarity of the peptides. Finally, we also conduct experiments on the latest versions of the ACP and CPP datasets. Overall, the experimental results show that our work is effective for the identification of therapeutic peptides."

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a growing public and veterinary health concern, and the ability to accurately predict AMR from antibiotics administration data is crucial for effectively treating and managing infections. While genomics-based approaches can provide better results, sequencing, assembling, and applying Machine Learning (ML) methods can take several hours. Therefore, alternative approaches are required. This study focused on using ML for antimicrobial stewardship by utilising data extracted from hospital electronic health records, which can be done in real-time, and developing an interpretable 1D-Transformer model for predicting AMR. A multi-baseline Integrated Gradient pipeline was also incorporated to interpret the model, and quantitative validation metrics were introduced to validate the model. The performance of the proposed 1D-Transformer model was evaluated using a dataset of urinary tract infection (UTI) patients with four antibiotics. The proposed 1D-Transformer model achieved 10% higher area under curve (AUC) in predicting AMR and outperformed traditional ML models. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) pipeline also provided interpretable results, identifying the signatures contributing to the predictions. This could be used as a decision support tool for personalised treatment, introducing AMR-aware food and management of AMR, and it could also be used to identify signatures for targeted interventions."

The abuse of traditional antibiotics has led to an increase in the resistance of bacteria and viruses. Similar to the function of antibacterial peptides, bacteriocins are more common as a kind of peptides produced by bacteria that have bactericidal or bacterial effects. More importantly, the marine environment is one of the most abundant resources for extracting marine microbial bacteriocins (MMBs). Identifying bacteriocins from marine microorganisms is a common goal for the development of new drugs. Effective use of MMBs will greatly alleviate the current antibiotic abuse problem. In this work, deep learning is used to identify meaningful MMBs. We propose a random multi-scale convolutional neural network method. In the scale setting, we set a random model to update the scale value randomly. The scale selection method can reduce the contingency caused by artificial setting under certain conditions, thereby making the method more extensive. The results show that the classification performance of the proposed method is better than the state-of-the-art classification methods. In addition, some potential MMBs are predicted, and some different sequence analyses are performed on these candidates. It is worth mentioning that after sequence analysis, the HNH endonucleases of different marine bacteria are considered as potential bacteriocins."

The antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has become one of the most serious global health issues due to misusing and overusing of antibiotics. Recently, different technologies were developed to determine bacteria susceptibility towards antibiotics; however, each of these technologies has its advantages and limitations in clinical applications. In this contribution, we aim to assess and automate the detection of bacterial susceptibilities towards three antibiotics; i.e. ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and piperacillin using a combination of image processing and machine learning algorithms. Therein, microscopic images were collected from different E. coli strains, then the convolutional neural network U-Net was implemented to segment the areas showing bacteria. Subsequently, the encoder part of the trained U-Net was utilized as a feature extractor, and the U-Net bottleneck features were utilized to predict the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). This one-class model was always trained on images of untreated controls of each bacterial strain while the image labels of treated bacteria were predicted as control or non-control images. If an image of treated bacteria is predicted as control, we assume that these bacteria resist this antibiotic. In contrast, the sensitive bacteria show different morphology of the control bacteria; therefore, images collected from these treated bacteria are expected to be classified as non-control. Our results showed 83% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve when OCSVM models were built using the U-Net bottleneck features of control bacteria images only. Additionally, the mean sensitivities of these one-class models are 91.67% and 86.61% for cefotaxime and piperacillin; respectively. The mean sensitivity for the prediction of ciprofloxacin is only 59.72% as the bacteria morphology was not fully detected by the proposed method.

Antibiotic resistance is an increasing public health threat. To combat it, a fast method to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of infecting pathogens is required. Here we present an optical imaging-based method to track the motion of single bacterial cells and generate a model to classify active and inactive cells based on the motion patterns of the individual cells. The model includes an image-processing algorithm to segment individual bacterial cells and track the motion of the cells over time, and a deep learning algorithm (Long Short-Term Memory network) to learn and determine if a bacterial cell is active or inactive. By applying the model to human urine specimens spiked with an Escherichia coli lab strain, we show that the method can accurately perform antibiotic susceptibility testing as fast as 30 minutes for five commonly used antibiotics."

Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) from genomic sequence data has become a significant component of overcoming the AMR challenge, especially given its potential for facilitating more rapid diagnostics and personalised antibiotic treatments. With the recent advances in sequencing technologies and computing power, deep learning models for genomic sequence data have been widely adopted to predict AMR more reliably and error-free. There are many different types of AMR; therefore, any practical AMR prediction system must be able to identify multiple AMRs present in a genomic sequence. Unfortunately, most genomic sequence datasets do not have all the labels marked, thereby making a deep learning modelling approach challenging owing to its reliance on labels for reliability and accuracy. This paper addresses this issue by presenting an effective deep learning solution, Mask-Loss 1D convolution neural network (ML-ConvNet), for AMR prediction on datasets with many missing labels. The core component of ML- ConvNet utilises a masked loss function that overcomes the effect of missing labels in predicting AMR. The proposed ML-ConvNet is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods in the literature by 10.5%, according to the F1 score. The proposed model’s performance is evaluated using different degrees of the missing label and is found to outperform the conventional approach by 76% in the F1 score when 86.68% of labels are missing. Furthermore, the ML-ConvNet was established with an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) pipeline, thereby making it ideally suited for hospital and healthcare settings, where model interpretability is an essential requirement."

In response to environmental threats, pathogens make several changes in their genome, leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Due to AMR, the pathogens do not respond to antibiotics. Amongst drug-resistant pathogens, the ESKAPEE group of bacteria poses a major threat to humans, and therefore World Health Organization has given them the highest priority status. Antibacterial peptides (ABPs) are a family of peptides found in nature that play a crucial role in the innate immune systems of organisms. These ABPs offer several advantages over widely used antibiotics. As a result, they have recently received a lot of attention as potential replacements for currently available antibiotics. But it is expensive and time-consuming to identify ABPs from natural sources. Thus, wet lab researchers employ various tools to screen promising ABPs rapidly. However, the main limitation of the existing tools is that they do not provide the minimum inhibitory concentration values against the ESKAPEE pathogens for the identified ABP. To address this, in the current work, we developed ESKAPEE-MICpred, a two-input model that utilizes transfer learning and ensemble learning techniques. The concept of ensemble learning was realized by combining the decisions provided by deep learning algorithms, whereas the concept of transfer learning was realized by utilizing pretrained amino acid embeddings. The proposed model has been deployed as a web server at https://eskapee-micpred.anvil.app/ to aid the scientific community."

The combination of Raman spectroscopy and deep learning technology provides an automatic, rapid, and accurate scheme for the clinical diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria. However, the accuracy of existing deep learning methods is still limited because of the single and fixed scales of deep neural networks. We propose a deep neural network that can learn multi-scale features of Raman spectra by using the automatic combination of multi-receptive fields of convolutional layers. This model is based on the expert knowledge that the discrimination information of Raman spectra is composed of multi-scale spectral peaks. We enhance the interpretability of the model by visualizing the activated wavenumbers of the bacterial spectrum that can be used for reference in related work. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and efficiency for bacterial identification on isolate-level, empiric-treatment-level, and antibiotic-resistance-level tasks. The clinical bacterial identification task requires significantly fewer patient samples to achieve similar accuracy. Therefore, this method has tremendous potential for the identification of clinical pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and prescription guidance."

Data-driven approaches for molecular diagnostics are emerging as an alternative to perform an accurate and inexpensive multi-pathogen detection. A novel technique called Amplification Curve Analysis (ACA) has been recently developed by coupling machine learning and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to enable the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a single reaction well. However, target classification purely relying on the amplification curve shapes faces several challenges, such as distribution discrepancies between different data sources (i.e., training vs testing). Optimisation of computational models is required to achieve higher performance of ACA classification in multiplex qPCR through the reduction of those discrepancies. Here, we proposed a novel transformer-based conditional domain adversarial network (T-CDAN) to eliminate data distribution differences between the source domain (synthetic DNA data) and the target domain (clinical isolate data). The labelled training data from the source domain and unlabelled testing data from the target domain are fed into the T-CDAN, which learns both domains' information simultaneously. After mapping the inputs into a domain-irrelevant space, T-CDAN removes the feature distribution differences and provides a clearer decision boundary for the classifier, resulting in a more accurate pathogen identification. Evaluation of 198 clinical isolates containing three types of carbapenem-resistant genes ( bla NDM , bla IMP and bla OXA-48 ) illustrates a curve-level accuracy of 93.1% and a sample-level accuracy of 97.0% using T-CDAN, showing an accuracy improvement of 20.9% and 4.9% respectively. This research emphasises the importance of deep domain adaptation to enable high-level multiplexing in a single qPCR reaction, providing a solid approach to extend qPCR instruments' capabilities in real-world clinical applications."

Objective: Several features of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal are related to muscle activity and fatigue. However, the time-evolution of these features are non-stationary and vary between subjects. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of adaptive algorithms to forecast sEMG feature of the trunk muscles. Methods: Shallow models and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to simultaneously learn and forecast 5 common sEMG features in real-time to provide tailored predictions. This was investigated for: up to a 25 second horizon; for 14 different muscles in the trunk; across 13 healthy subjects; while they were performing various exercises. Results: The CNN was able to forecast 25 seconds ahead of time, with 6.88% mean absolute percentage error and 3.72% standard deviation of absolute percentage error, across all the features. Moreover, the CNN outperforms the best shallow model in terms of a figure of merit combining accuracy and precision by at least 30% for all the 5 features. Conclusion: Even though the sEMG features are non-stationary and vary between subjects, adaptive learning and forecasting, especially using CNNs, can provide accurate and precise forecasts across a range of physical activities. Significance: The proposed models provide the groundwork for a wearable device which can forecast muscle fatigue in the trunk, so as to potentially prevent low back pain. Additionally, the explicit real-time forecasting of sEMG features provides a general model which can be applied to many applications of muscle activity monitoring, which helps practitioners and physiotherapists improve therapy."

Microbial contamination of cell culture is a major problem encountered both in academic labs and in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industries. A broad spectrum of microbes, including mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, and viruses are the causative agents of cell-culture contamination. Unfortunately, the existing disinfection techniques lack selectivity and/or lead to the development of drug-resistance, and more importantly there is no universal method to address all the microbes. Here, we report a novel, chemical-free visible ultrashort pulsed laser method for cell-culture disinfection. The ultrashort pulsed laser technology inactivates pathogens with mechanical means, a paradigm shift from the traditional pharmaceutical and chemical approaches. We demonstrate that ultrashort pulsed laser treatment can efficiently inactivate mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast, and viruses with good preservation of mammalian cell viability. Our results indicate that this ultrashort pulsed laser technology has the potential to serve as a universal method for the disinfection of cell culture."

Syntactical rule based approaches for aspect extraction, which are free from expensive manual annotation, are promising in practice. These approaches extract aspects mainly through the dependency relations in the surface sentence structures. However, deep and rich semantic information hidden in sentences which can help improve aspect extraction, is difficult for them to capture. In order to address the problem, this paper first proposes to employ Logic Programming to explore the feasibility of deep semantic representation, then proposes Deep2S, a hybrid rule-based method to improve the performance of aspect extraction. Deep2S integrates deep semantic representation such as Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) with syntactic structure. It can take advantage of the syntactical rules to obtain dependency relations in the surface structure as well as the semantic rules to capture deep semantic information. Our experiments are conducted on eight popular review datasets using two evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of deep semantic representation and the ability of Deep2S to improve the performance of aspect extraction in opinion mining."

Despite the great manufactures' efforts to achieve customer satisfaction and improve their performance, social media opinion mining is still on the fly a big challenge. Current opinion mining requires sophisticated feature engineering and syntactic word embedding without considering semantic interaction between aspect term and opinionated features, which degrade the performance of most of opinion mining tasks, especially those that are designed for smart manufacturing. Research on intelligent aspect level opinion mining (AOM) follows the fast proliferation of user-generated data through social media for industrial manufacturing purposes. Google's pre-trained language model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) widely overcomes existing methods in eleven natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which makes it the standard way for semantic text representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning model for fine-grained aspect-based opinion mining, named as FGAOM. First, we train the BERT model on three specific domain corpora for domain adaption, then use adjusted BERT as embedding layer for concurrent extraction of local and global context features. Then, we propose Multi-head Self-Attention (MSHA) to effectively fuse internal semantic text representation and take advantage of convolutional layers to model aspect term interaction with surrounding sentiment features. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated via extensive experiments on three public datasets. Results show that performance of the proposed model outperforms performances of recent the-of-the-art models."

The contextual understanding ability in complex conversation scenarios has been a challenging issue, and existing methods mostly failed to possess such characteristics. To bridge such gap, this paper formulates a novel composite large language model to investigate such issue. As a result, taking English context as the scene, a Transformer-BERT integrated model-based automatic conversation model is proposed in this work. Firstly, the unidirectional BERT-based automatic conversation model is improved by introducing attention mechanism. It is expected to enhance feature expression for conversation texts by linking context to identify long-difficult sentences. Besides, a bidirectional Transformer encoder is utilized as the input layer before the BERT encoder. Through the two modules, dynamic language training based on English situational conversations can be completed to build the automatic conversation model. The proposed conversation model is further assessed on massive real-world English language context in terms of conversation performance. The experimental results show that compared with traditional rule-based or machine learning methods, the proposal has significantly improved response quality and fluency in English context. It can more accurately understand context, capture subtle semantic differences, and generate more coherent responses."

Software bug localization is an important step in the software maintenance process. Automatic bug localization can reduce the time consumed in the process of localization. Some techniques are applied in the bug localization process, but those techniques suffer from limitations in time and accuracy. This paper proposes a phase-based bug localization approach to overcome these limitations. The approach is composed of three main phases which are raw data preparation, package classification, and source code recommendation. The main input to our approach is a bug report and the source code of the past versions for the target system of interest. From the bug report, various information is utilized: the summary, the description, the stack traces, and the fixed source code files. The raw data preparation phase is used to restructure those inputs. The package classification phase aims to locate the package that would include the source code to be modified as a first step, hence reducing the time needed to locate the source code file due to the lexical mismatch between those files and the bug report data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a sentence embedding technique, is utilized in the package classification and source code recommendation phases. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing approaches according to TOP-N rank and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) evaluation metrics."

In order to automatically generate multiple labels for the event text of the Chinese government hotline, this paper propose a multi-label classification framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN), BERT, and memory network. The framework consists of three modules: label count prediction module, label semantic insert module, and label selection module. In the label count prediction module, this paper constructs the event graph with the abstract meaning representation (AMR) and extract the event topic information vector with GCN. To predict the label count, this paper first use BERT to extract the event semantic information vector and then fuse it with the event topic information vector (GCN-BERT fusion vector) with a dynamic fusion gate. In the label semantic insert module, to obtain the event label candidate set, this paper uses a multi-hop memory network to store the event label semantic information, and then use the answer selection framework, which matches the GCN-BERT fusion vector with the event label semantic memory vector. In label selection module, this paper uses the label count based multi-label selection to sort the event label candidate set and guide to output the optimal multi-label set of the event. Comparison experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms all baselines and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each module."

Software vulnerabilities are among the significant causes of security breaches. Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset. Final experimental findings show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches’ performance by improving precision, recall, F1-score, and False Negative Rate (FNR) by 2.41%-8.95%, 4.0%-16.28%, 1.85%-12.74%, and 18% respectively. The proposed model reports the lowest FNR in the literature, a significant achievement given the cost-based nature of vulnerability detectors."
