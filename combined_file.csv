Efficient therapeutic peptide prediction is critical for peptide drug discovery. However, most of the existing methods only make effective predictions for one class of therapeutic peptides. It is worth noting that currently no predictive method considers sequence length information as a distinct feature of therapeutic peptides. In this article, a novel deep learning approach with matrix factorization for predicting therapeutic peptides (DeepTPpred) by integrating length information are proposed. The matrix factorization layer can learn the potential features of the encoded sequence through the mechanism of first compression and then restoration. And the length features of the sequence of therapeutic peptides are embedded with encoded amino acid sequences. To automatically learn therapeutic peptide predictions, these latent features are input into the neural networks with self-attention mechanism. On eight therapeutic peptide datasets, DeepTPpred achieved excellent prediction results. Based on these datasets, we first integrated eight datasets to obtain a full therapeutic peptide integration dataset. Then, we obtained two functional integration datasets based on the functional similarity of the peptides. Finally, we also conduct experiments on the latest versions of the ACP and CPP datasets.

A novel technique called Amplification Curve Analysis (ACA) has been recently developed by coupling machine learning and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to enable the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a single reaction well. However, target classification purely relying on the amplification curve shapes faces several challenges, such as distribution discrepancies between different data sources (i.e., training vs testing). Optimisation of computational models is required to achieve higher performance of ACA classification in multiplex qPCR through the reduction of those discrepancies. Here, we proposed a novel transformer-based conditional domain adversarial network (T-CDAN) to eliminate data distribution differences between the source domain (synthetic DNA data) and the target domain (clinical isolate data). The labelled training data from the source domain and unlabelled testing data from the target domain are fed into the T-CDAN, which learns both domains' information simultaneously. After mapping the inputs into a domain-irrelevant space, T-CDAN removes the feature distribution differences and provides a clearer decision boundary for the classifier, resulting in a more accurate pathogen identification. Evaluation of 198 clinical isolates containing three types of carbapenem-resistant genes (blaNDM, blaIMP and blaOXA-48) illustrates a curve-level accuracy of 93.1% and a sample-level accuracy of 97.0% using T-CDAN, showing an accuracy improvement of 20.9% and 4.9% respectively.

AVs utilize the power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve their self-driving learning experiences. The sudden surge in the number of AVs raises the need for distributed learning ecosystem to optimize their self-driving experiences at a rapid pace. Toward this goal, federated learning (FL) benefits, which can create a distributed learning environment for AVs. But, the traditional FL transfers the raw input data directly to a server, which leads to privacy concerns among the end-users. The concept of blockchain helps us to protect privacy, but it requires additional computational infrastructure. The extra infrastructure increases the operational cost for the company handling and maintaining the AVs. Motivated by this, in this paper, the authors introduced the concept of gradient encryption in FL, which preserves the users’ privacy without the additional computation requirements. The computational power present in the edge devices helps to fine-tune the local model and encrypt the input data to preserve privacy without any drop in performance. For performance evaluation, the authors have built a German traffic sign recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm-based classification system and GeFL. The simulation process is carried out over a wide range of input parameters to analyze the performance at scale.

Typically, DL models are either randomly initialized following a statistical distribution or pretrained on tasks from other domains in the form of transfer learning without accounting for the unique characteristics of wireless signals. Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables the learning of useful representations from Radio Frequency (RF) signals themselves even when only limited training data samples with labels are available. We present a self-supervised RF signal representation learning method and apply it to the automatic modulation recognition (AMR) task by specifically formulating a set of transformations to capture the wireless signal characteristics.

The backbone of the wireless communication is modulation, which involves various techniques with its own unique characteristics. As modulation techniques evolve in intricacy and diversity, the need for modulation recognition becomes apparent. Traditional modulation recognition relies on human intervention to classify modulation types in received signals, a time-consuming and laborious process prone to human error and inefficiency. Consequently, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is introduced to autonomously classify modulation types without human interventions. In the current era, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL) has gained prominence, providing numerous advantages across various domains, including AMR. While many DL-based AMR models have been developed, their efficacy reduces at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, we propose a hybrid DL model for AMR, named the in-phase and quadrature - temporal graph convolutional network (IQ-TGCN) to enhance the recognition performance at low SNR. Integrating graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, the IQ-TGCN takes a node feature matrix as input, derived from the magnitude differences between each node. In comparative assessments against other DL models, our model has consistently exhibited superior performance. To enhance its capabilities further, we integrated deep transfer learning, leading to a remarkable 30% improvement in classification accuracy. Notably, at a SNR of 10 dB, IQ-TGCN reached its pinnacle, attaining an impressive accuracy of 99%, all the while significantly reducing training time by nearly threefold.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3388490,"Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand(grant numbers:RGNS 64-061); Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand, and the Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant (TA/RA) Scholarship from Chiang Mai University; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499794,Automatic modulation recognition;deep learning;deep transfer learning;graph convolutional network;long short-term memory;wireless communication,Modulation;Transfer learning;Long short term memory;Data models;Wireless communication;Training;Task analysis,,,,36.0,CCBYNCND,15 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Traditional AMR approaches predominantly utilize raw in-phase/quadrature symbols (I/Q), amplitude/phase (A/P), or pre-processed data (e.g., high-order cumulates, spectrum images, or constellation diagrams) as inputs for the recognition model. However, it is difficult to achieve superior performance with only a single type of data as input. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel hybrid learning framework that integrates convolutional layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, fully connected layers and classification layers. The model is built for modeling spatial-temporal correlations from four signal cues (including I/Q signals, A/P signals, I, and Q signals), which aims to explore various differences and leverage the complements from multiple data-form. Two functions employed during the data conversion process further enhance the non-linear representational capacity of the model, thereby boosting the recognition accuracy of the model.

However, deep learning models suffer from the heavy resource consumption problem caused by the huge amount of parameters and high computational complexity, which limit their performance in scenarios that require fast response. Therefore, the deep learning models must be compressed and accelerated, where channel pruning is an effective method to reduce the amount of computation and can speed up models inference. In this paper, we propose a new channel pruning method suitable for AMR deep learning models. We consider both the channel redundancy of the convolutional layer and the channel importance measured by the  $\gamma $  scale factor of the batch normalization (BN) layer. Our proposed method jointly evaluates the model channels from the perspectives of structural similarity and numerical value, and generates evaluation indicators for selecting channels. This method can prevent cutting out important convolutional layer channels. And combined with other strategies such as one-shot pruning strategy and local pruning strategy, the model classification performance can be guaranteed further. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of different AMR models.

Many works in the literature have considered optimizing the allocation of on-demand slices, assuming the absolute availability of resources and their accurate load. However, accurately allocating future network slices remains challenging due to the error in load prediction, diverse Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), resource price variations, and the potential for over- or under-provisioning. This study presents a two-phase intelligent approach to address these challenges. The framework proactively predicts different slice loads while considering prediction errors in optimizing future slices with varied KPIs in a cost-efficient manner. Specifically, our method utilizes historical load data per service and employs AI-based forecasts for service load prediction.

Motivated by the fact that an increasing number of applications are using Machine Learning (ML) inference from the data samples collected at the EDs, we study the problem of offloading inference jobs by considering the following novel aspects: 1) in contrast to a typical computational job, the processing time of an inference job depends on the size of the ML model, and 2) recently proposed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for resource-constrained devices provide the choice of scaling down the model size by trading off the inference accuracy. Considering that multiple ML models are available at the ED, and a powerful ML model is available at the ES, we formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with the objective of maximizing the total inference accuracy of $n$n data samples at the ED subject to a time constraint $T$T on the makespan. Noting that the problem is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm Accuracy Maximization using LP-Relaxation and Rounding (AMR$^{2}$2) and prove that it results in a makespan at most $\text{2}T$2T and achieves a total accuracy that is lower by a small constant from the optimal total accuracy implying that AMR$^{2}$2 is asymptotically optimal. Further, if the data samples are identical we propose Accuracy Maximization using Dynamic Programming (AMDP), an optimal pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. Furthermore, we extend AMR$^{2}$2 for the case of multiple ESs, where each ES is equipped with a powerful ML model.

Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset.

Toward this goal, federated learning (FL) benefits, which can create a distributed learning environment for AVs.

Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset.

Although important improvements have been shown in previous topic-guided image captioning models, some challenges remain unsolved, such as the independence of the topic predictors and the sentence generators, resulting in ineffective exploitation of semantic information. Also, all the predicted topics or the top-one topic are used throughout the whole captioning task without considering the current time step's linguistic context, which deviates the captioning network to focus on inaccurate image objects. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel image captioning method consisting of four modules: enhanced topic predictor (ETP), retrieval-based topics re-weighting module (RTR), subsequent topic predictor (STP), and caption generation module. The prediction and generation modules are trained in an end-to-end manner to promote the efficient use of topics by predicting suitable topics at each time step. ETP predicts the topics using the image features, and is enhanced with topic embedding (TE). The RTR is only applied in the testing stage for re-weighting the topics predicted by ETP. In each time step, the STP automatically predicts concise topics subsets to alleviate the diversity of the image topics. Compared with the existing topic-based models, our model can automatically generate more accurate and diverse captions, boosting the explainability of how the topics influence the generated word in each time step.

This paper presents a feasibility study on the using a multitask neural network with event cameras for real-time facial analytics. Our proposed network simultaneously estimates head pose, eye gaze, and facial occlusions. Notably, the network is trained on synthetic event camera data, and its performance is demonstrated and validated using real event data in real-time driving scenarios. To compensate for global head motion, we introduce a novel event integration method capable of handling both short and long-term temporal dependencies. The performance of our facial analytics method is quantitatively evaluated in both controlled lab environments and unconstrained driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that useful accuracy and computational speed is achieved by the proposed method to determining head pose and relative eye-gaze direction. This shows that neuromorphic facial analytics can be realized in real-time and are well-suited for edge/embedded computing deployments.

Also, all the predicted topics or the top-one topic are used throughout the whole captioning task without considering the current time step's linguistic context, which deviates the captioning network to focus on inaccurate image objects.

The prediction and generation modules are trained in an end-to-end manner to promote the efficient use of topics by predicting suitable topics at each time step. ETP predicts the topics using the image features, and is enhanced with topic embedding (TE). The RTR is only applied in the testing stage for re-weighting the topics predicted by ETP. In each time step, the STP automatically predicts concise topics subsets to alleviate the diversity of the image topics.

The backbone of the wireless communication is modulation, which involves various techniques with its own unique characteristics. As modulation techniques evolve in intricacy and diversity, the need for modulation recognition becomes apparent. Traditional modulation recognition relies on human intervention to classify modulation types in received signals, a time-consuming and laborious process prone to human error and inefficiency. Consequently, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is introduced to autonomously classify modulation types without human interventions. In the current era, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL) has gained prominence, providing numerous advantages across various domains, including AMR. While many DL-based AMR models have been developed, their efficacy reduces at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, we propose a hybrid DL model for AMR, named the in-phase and quadrature - temporal graph convolutional network (IQ-TGCN) to enhance the recognition performance at low SNR. Integrating graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, the IQ-TGCN takes a node feature matrix as input, derived from the magnitude differences between each node. In comparative assessments against other DL models, our model has consistently exhibited superior performance. To enhance its capabilities further, we integrated deep transfer learning, leading to a remarkable 30% improvement in classification accuracy.

However, it is difficult to achieve superior performance with only a single type of data as input.

Additionally, the spatial distribution of the collected traffic data is limited by the location of the deployed hardware sensors. Probe vehicle data can be used to overcome these limitations. Traffic modeling for estimation and prediction is a complex task due to the stochastic nonlinear spatiotemporal dependencies exhibited by traffic parameters.

The method utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks for spatial dependency extraction and Long Short-Term Memory networks to model temporal dependencies. The proposed method generated superior traffic results compared to the baseline models. Additionally, the model demonstrated robustness against perturbations caused by the low rate.

This progression has led to the emergence of Virtual Networks (VN) and Network Slicing, enabling industries to enhance their services and applications by establishing virtual networks that utilize shared physical infrastructure. Many works in the literature have considered optimizing the allocation of on-demand slices, assuming the absolute availability of resources and their accurate load. However, accurately allocating future network slices remains challenging due to the error in load prediction, diverse Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), resource price variations, and the potential for over- or under-provisioning. This study presents a two-phase intelligent approach to address these challenges. The framework proactively predicts different slice loads while considering prediction errors in optimizing future slices with varied KPIs in a cost-efficient manner. Specifically, our method utilizes historical load data per service and employs AI-based forecasts for service load prediction. Subsequently, it employs a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent on O-RAN’s virtual Control Unit (vCU) and virtual Distributed unit (vDU) to correct errors in prediction and optimize the cost of slice allocation based on service KPI requirements, ultimately pre-allocating future network slices at reduced costs. Through experimental validation against various baselines and state-of-the-art solutions, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution, achieving a notable reduction (37-51%) in the average cost of allocated slices while inquiring about (1.5-7%) of additional resources compared to the state-of-the-art..",2644-125X,,10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3390591,"NPRP-Standard Thirteen Cycle(grant numbers:NPRP13S-0205-200265); Qatar National Library; GSRA through the Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:NPRP13S-0205-200265,GSRA9-L-1-0518-22022); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10504555,Reinforcement learning;network slicing;load prediction;smart health;error-correction,Costs;Network slicing;Predictive models;Load modeling;Routing;Resource management;Forecasting,,,,51.0,CCBY,17 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

On the one hand, AI-based AMR methods can outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

In the presence of noise interference, single-modal features fail to fully represent the characteristics of different modulated signals. While the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) and time–frequency maps can adequately represent the signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains, the direct integration of the two modalities is ineffective because of the variations in shape, information granularity, and noise manifestation. To address the low recognition rate caused by the above issues, we propose a two-stream transformer (TSTR)-based network for AMR of UWA signals. First, the input preprocessing layer obtains the I/Q and time–frequency features from the received signals. Then, the feature capture layer (FCL) extracts high-dimensional signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. Finally, the classification layer estimates the modulation of the signals. A multihead self-attention module with adaptive soft thresholding is used in the FCL to provide noise reduction and redundant feature rejection while retaining context information. Moreover, multiscale ghost convolution is employed to address the inability of the transformer to efficiently extract spatial characteristics from the signals. Results are presented using real UWA channels from the Watermark data set for two different seas which show that the TSTR improves recognition by 1.2% and 5.9% over the best existing model.

Antibacterial peptides (ABPs) are a family of peptides found in nature that play a crucial role in the innate immune systems of organisms.

We consider both the channel redundancy of the convolutional layer and the channel importance measured by the  $\gamma $  scale factor of the batch normalization (BN) layer. Our proposed method jointly evaluates the model channels from the perspectives of structural similarity and numerical value, and generates evaluation indicators for selecting channels. This method can prevent cutting out important convolutional layer channels. And combined with other strategies such as one-shot pruning strategy and local pruning strategy, the model classification performance can be guaranteed further. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of different AMR models. Compared with other classical pruning methods, the proposed method can not only better maintain the classification accuracy, but also achieve a higher compression ratio. Finally, we deploy the pruned network model to edge devices, validating the significant acceleration effect of our method.",2332-7731,,10.1109/TCCN.2023.3329000,"Key R&D Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2022C01018); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2001,61973273); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LR19F030001); Major Key Project of PCL(grant numbers:PCL2022A03,PCL2021A02,PCL2021A09); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10304321,Automatic modulation recognition;deep learning;neural network model pruning;edge devices,Neural networks;Convolution;Computational modeling;Modulation;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Load modeling,,1.0,,57.0,IEEE,1 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset.

The backbone of the wireless communication is modulation, which involves various techniques with its own unique characteristics. As modulation techniques evolve in intricacy and diversity, the need for modulation recognition becomes apparent. Traditional modulation recognition relies on human intervention to classify modulation types in received signals, a time-consuming and laborious process prone to human error and inefficiency. Consequently, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is introduced to autonomously classify modulation types without human interventions. In the current era, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL) has gained prominence, providing numerous advantages across various domains, including AMR. While many DL-based AMR models have been developed, their efficacy reduces at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, we propose a hybrid DL model for AMR, named the in-phase and quadrature - temporal graph convolutional network (IQ-TGCN) to enhance the recognition performance at low SNR. Integrating graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, the IQ-TGCN takes a node feature matrix as input, derived from the magnitude differences between each node. In comparative assessments against other DL models, our model has consistently exhibited superior performance. To enhance its capabilities further, we integrated deep transfer learning, leading to a remarkable 30% improvement in classification accuracy.

This unique technology offers numerous advantages, including high temporal resolution, low latency, wide dynamic range, and reduced power consumption. These characteristics make event cameras particularly well-suited for sensing applications such as monitoring drivers or human behavior. This paper presents a feasibility study on the using a multitask neural network with event cameras for real-time facial analytics. Our proposed network simultaneously estimates head pose, eye gaze, and facial occlusions. Notably, the network is trained on synthetic event camera data, and its performance is demonstrated and validated using real event data in real-time driving scenarios.

Motivated by the fact that an increasing number of applications are using Machine Learning (ML) inference from the data samples collected at the EDs, we study the problem of offloading inference jobs by considering the following novel aspects: 1) in contrast to a typical computational job, the processing time of an inference job depends on the size of the ML model, and 2) recently proposed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for resource-constrained devices provide the choice of scaling down the model size by trading off the inference accuracy. Considering that multiple ML models are available at the ED, and a powerful ML model is available at the ES, we formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with the objective of maximizing the total inference accuracy of $n$n data samples at the ED subject to a time constraint $T$T on the makespan. Noting that the problem is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm Accuracy Maximization using LP-Relaxation and Rounding (AMR$^{2}$2) and prove that it results in a makespan at most $\text{2}T$2T and achieves a total accuracy that is lower by a small constant from the optimal total accuracy implying that AMR$^{2}$2 is asymptotically optimal. Further, if the data samples are identical we propose Accuracy Maximization using Dynamic Programming (AMDP), an optimal pseudo-polynomial time algorithm.

Hunting APTs demands the processing of ever-growing large-scale PGs of audit logs for a wide range of activities over months or years, i.e., multi-terabyte graphs.

Then, the feature capture layer (FCL) extracts high-dimensional signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. Finally, the classification layer estimates the modulation of the signals. A multihead self-attention module with adaptive soft thresholding is used in the FCL to provide noise reduction and redundant feature rejection while retaining context information. Moreover, multiscale ghost convolution is employed to address the inability of the transformer to efficiently extract spatial characteristics from the signals. Results are presented using real UWA channels from the Watermark data set for two different seas which show that the TSTR improves recognition by 1.2% and 5.9% over the best existing model. Further, it has better generalization capabilities and the model has a small number of parameters so the time complexity is low.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3367852,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52171341,62231028); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10440437,Adaptive soft thresholding;automatic modulation recognition (AMR);multiscale ghost convolution;transformer,Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;Modulation;Transformers;Adaptation models;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks,,,,52.0,IEEE,20 Feb 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Traditional modulation recognition relies on human intervention to classify modulation types in received signals, a time-consuming and laborious process prone to human error and inefficiency. Consequently, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is introduced to autonomously classify modulation types without human interventions.

Additionally, traffic prediction is vital for many data-driven intelligent transportation system applications. Most traffic estimation and prediction methods rely on infrastructure-based sensors to collect traffic parameters. However, infrastructure-based data collection can be costly and time consuming to set up and maintain. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the collected traffic data is limited by the location of the deployed hardware sensors. Probe vehicle data can be used to overcome these limitations. Traffic modeling for estimation and prediction is a complex task due to the stochastic nonlinear spatiotemporal dependencies exhibited by traffic parameters. In this paper, a deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence architecture called Seq2seq GCN-LSTM was proposed to estimate and predict network-wide traffic volume and speed. The proposed method utilizes short-term historical traffic data collected from a low-penetration rate probe vehicle fleet to estimate and predict traffic parameters up to 60-minutes ahead. The method utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks for spatial dependency extraction and Long Short-Term Memory networks to model temporal dependencies. The proposed method generated superior traffic results compared to the baseline models. Additionally, the model demonstrated robustness against perturbations caused by the low rate. Furthermore, the probe vehicle penetration rate was varied to test its effect on the proposed method’s modeling capability.

Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset.

Traditional AMR approaches predominantly utilize raw in-phase/quadrature symbols (I/Q), amplitude/phase (A/P), or pre-processed data (e.g., high-order cumulates, spectrum images, or constellation diagrams) as inputs for the recognition model. However, it is difficult to achieve superior performance with only a single type of data as input. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel hybrid learning framework that integrates convolutional layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, fully connected layers and classification layers. The model is built for modeling spatial-temporal correlations from four signal cues (including I/Q signals, A/P signals, I, and Q signals), which aims to explore various differences and leverage the complements from multiple data-form. Two functions employed during the data conversion process further enhance the non-linear representational capacity of the model, thereby boosting the recognition accuracy of the model.

In the presence of noise interference, single-modal features fail to fully represent the characteristics of different modulated signals. While the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) and time–frequency maps can adequately represent the signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains, the direct integration of the two modalities is ineffective because of the variations in shape, information granularity, and noise manifestation. To address the low recognition rate caused by the above issues, we propose a two-stream transformer (TSTR)-based network for AMR of UWA signals. First, the input preprocessing layer obtains the I/Q and time–frequency features from the received signals. Then, the feature capture layer (FCL) extracts high-dimensional signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. Finally, the classification layer estimates the modulation of the signals. A multihead self-attention module with adaptive soft thresholding is used in the FCL to provide noise reduction and redundant feature rejection while retaining context information. Moreover, multiscale ghost convolution is employed to address the inability of the transformer to efficiently extract spatial characteristics from the signals. Results are presented using real UWA channels from the Watermark data set for two different seas which show that the TSTR improves recognition by 1.2% and 5.9% over the best existing model.

Although important improvements have been shown in previous topic-guided image captioning models, some challenges remain unsolved, such as the independence of the topic predictors and the sentence generators, resulting in ineffective exploitation of semantic information. Also, all the predicted topics or the top-one topic are used throughout the whole captioning task without considering the current time step's linguistic context, which deviates the captioning network to focus on inaccurate image objects. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel image captioning method consisting of four modules: enhanced topic predictor (ETP), retrieval-based topics re-weighting module (RTR), subsequent topic predictor (STP), and caption generation module. The prediction and generation modules are trained in an end-to-end manner to promote the efficient use of topics by predicting suitable topics at each time step. ETP predicts the topics using the image features, and is enhanced with topic embedding (TE). The RTR is only applied in the testing stage for re-weighting the topics predicted by ETP. In each time step, the STP automatically predicts concise topics subsets to alleviate the diversity of the image topics. Compared with the existing topic-based models, our model can automatically generate more accurate and diverse captions, boosting the explainability of how the topics influence the generated word in each time step.

We first investigate similarities of different corresponding layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) models in FL, and find that there is a lot of redundant information in its model feature extractors. For this, we propose a communication-efficient federated aggregation algorithm named FedSL (Federated Split Layers) to reduce the communication overhead.

Each client only transfers partial parameters of those layers that are selected, which reduces the number of parameters. FedSL aggregates the global model in each group and concatenates the parameters of all groups according to the order of layers.

This unique technology offers numerous advantages, including high temporal resolution, low latency, wide dynamic range, and reduced power consumption. These characteristics make event cameras particularly well-suited for sensing applications such as monitoring drivers or human behavior. This paper presents a feasibility study on the using a multitask neural network with event cameras for real-time facial analytics. Our proposed network simultaneously estimates head pose, eye gaze, and facial occlusions. Notably, the network is trained on synthetic event camera data, and its performance is demonstrated and validated using real event data in real-time driving scenarios. To compensate for global head motion, we introduce a novel event integration method capable of handling both short and long-term temporal dependencies. The performance of our facial analytics method is quantitatively evaluated in both controlled lab environments and unconstrained driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that useful accuracy and computational speed is achieved by the proposed method to determining head pose and relative eye-gaze direction. This shows that neuromorphic facial analytics can be realized in real-time and are well-suited for edge/embedded computing deployments.

Instead, phage therapy, which invades and lyses specific pathogenic bacteria without affecting beneficial bacteria, becomes more and more popular to treat bacterial infectious diseases. For the effective phage therapy, it requires to accurately predict potential phage-host interactions from heterogeneous information network consisting of bacteria and phages. Although many models have been proposed for predicting phage-host interactions, most methods fail to consider fully the sparsity and unconnectedness of phage-host heterogeneous information network, deriving the undesirable performance on phage-host interactions prediction. To address the challenge, we propose an effective model called GERMAN-PHI for predicting Phage-Host Interactions via Graph Embedding Representation learning with Multi-head Attention mechaNism. In GERMAN-PHI, the multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to learn representations of phages and hosts from multiple perspectives of phage-host associations, addressing the sparsity and unconnectedness in phage-host heterogeneous information network.

Due to AMR, the pathogens do not respond to antibiotics. Amongst drug-resistant pathogens, the ESKAPEE group of bacteria poses a major threat to humans, and therefore World Health Organization has given them the highest priority status. Antibacterial peptides (ABPs) are a family of peptides found in nature that play a crucial role in the innate immune systems of organisms. These ABPs offer several advantages over widely used antibiotics. As a result, they have recently received a lot of attention as potential replacements for currently available antibiotics. But it is expensive and time-consuming to identify ABPs from natural sources. Thus, wet lab researchers employ various tools to screen promising ABPs rapidly.

Many works in the literature have considered optimizing the allocation of on-demand slices, assuming the absolute availability of resources and their accurate load.

The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences.

In the presence of noise interference, single-modal features fail to fully represent the characteristics of different modulated signals. While the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) and time–frequency maps can adequately represent the signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains, the direct integration of the two modalities is ineffective because of the variations in shape, information granularity, and noise manifestation. To address the low recognition rate caused by the above issues, we propose a two-stream transformer (TSTR)-based network for AMR of UWA signals. First, the input preprocessing layer obtains the I/Q and time–frequency features from the received signals. Then, the feature capture layer (FCL) extracts high-dimensional signal features in the time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. Finally, the classification layer estimates the modulation of the signals. A multihead self-attention module with adaptive soft thresholding is used in the FCL to provide noise reduction and redundant feature rejection while retaining context information. Moreover, multiscale ghost convolution is employed to address the inability of the transformer to efficiently extract spatial characteristics from the signals. Results are presented using real UWA channels from the Watermark data set for two different seas which show that the TSTR improves recognition by 1.2% and 5.9% over the best existing model.

AVs utilize the power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve their self-driving learning experiences. The sudden surge in the number of AVs raises the need for distributed learning ecosystem to optimize their self-driving experiences at a rapid pace. Toward this goal, federated learning (FL) benefits, which can create a distributed learning environment for AVs. But, the traditional FL transfers the raw input data directly to a server, which leads to privacy concerns among the end-users. The concept of blockchain helps us to protect privacy, but it requires additional computational infrastructure. The extra infrastructure increases the operational cost for the company handling and maintaining the AVs. Motivated by this, in this paper, the authors introduced the concept of gradient encryption in FL, which preserves the users’ privacy without the additional computation requirements. The computational power present in the edge devices helps to fine-tune the local model and encrypt the input data to preserve privacy without any drop in performance. For performance evaluation, the authors have built a German traffic sign recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm-based classification system and GeFL.

The backbone of the wireless communication is modulation, which involves various techniques with its own unique characteristics. As modulation techniques evolve in intricacy and diversity, the need for modulation recognition becomes apparent. Traditional modulation recognition relies on human intervention to classify modulation types in received signals, a time-consuming and laborious process prone to human error and inefficiency. Consequently, automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is introduced to autonomously classify modulation types without human interventions. In the current era, artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL) has gained prominence, providing numerous advantages across various domains, including AMR. While many DL-based AMR models have been developed, their efficacy reduces at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, we propose a hybrid DL model for AMR, named the in-phase and quadrature - temporal graph convolutional network (IQ-TGCN) to enhance the recognition performance at low SNR. Integrating graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, the IQ-TGCN takes a node feature matrix as input, derived from the magnitude differences between each node. In comparative assessments against other DL models, our model has consistently exhibited superior performance. To enhance its capabilities further, we integrated deep transfer learning, leading to a remarkable 30% improvement in classification accuracy.

Antibacterial peptides (ABPs) are a family of peptides found in nature that play a crucial role in the innate immune systems of organisms.

Instead, phage therapy, which invades and lyses specific pathogenic bacteria without affecting beneficial bacteria, becomes more and more popular to treat bacterial infectious diseases. For the effective phage therapy, it requires to accurately predict potential phage-host interactions from heterogeneous information network consisting of bacteria and phages. Although many models have been proposed for predicting phage-host interactions, most methods fail to consider fully the sparsity and unconnectedness of phage-host heterogeneous information network, deriving the undesirable performance on phage-host interactions prediction. To address the challenge, we propose an effective model called GERMAN-PHI for predicting Phage-Host Interactions via Graph Embedding Representation learning with Multi-head Attention mechaNism. In GERMAN-PHI, the multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to learn representations of phages and hosts from multiple perspectives of phage-host associations, addressing the sparsity and unconnectedness in phage-host heterogeneous information network.

As a result, taking English context as the scene, a Transformer-BERT integrated model-based automatic conversation model is proposed in this work. Firstly, the unidirectional BERT-based automatic conversation model is improved by introducing attention mechanism. It is expected to enhance feature expression for conversation texts by linking context to identify long-difficult sentences. Besides, a bidirectional Transformer encoder is utilized as the input layer before the BERT encoder. Through the two modules, dynamic language training based on English situational conversations can be completed to build the automatic conversation model. The proposed conversation model is further assessed on massive real-world English language context in terms of conversation performance.

The approach is composed of three main phases which are raw data preparation, package classification, and source code recommendation. The main input to our approach is a bug report and the source code of the past versions for the target system of interest. From the bug report, various information is utilized: the summary, the description, the stack traces, and the fixed source code files. The raw data preparation phase is used to restructure those inputs. The package classification phase aims to locate the package that would include the source code to be modified as a first step, hence reducing the time needed to locate the source code file due to the lexical mismatch between those files and the bug report data.

Vulnerabilities can severely compromise software security if exploited by malicious attacks and may result in catastrophic losses. Hence, Automatic vulnerability detection methods promise to mitigate attack risks and safeguard software security. This paper introduces a novel model for automatic vulnerability detection of source code vulnerabilities dubbed DB-CBIL using a hybrid deep learning model based on Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DistilBERT). The proposed model considers contextualized word embeddings using the language model for the syntax and semantics of source code functions based on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. The model includes two main phases. First, using a vulnerable code dataset, the pre-trained DistilBert transformer is fine-tuned for word embedding. Second, a hybrid deep learning model detects which code functions are vulnerable. The hybrid model is built on two Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The first model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for extracting features. The second model is Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), which has been used to maintain the sequential order of the data as it can handle lengthy token sequences. The utilized source code dataset is derived from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD) benchmark dataset. Final experimental findings show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches’ performance by improving precision, recall, F1-score, and False Negative Rate (FNR) by 2.41%-8.95%, 4.0%-16.28%, 1.85%-12.74%, and 18% respectively.

A novel technique called Amplification Curve Analysis (ACA) has been recently developed by coupling machine learning and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) to enable the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a single reaction well. However, target classification purely relying on the amplification curve shapes faces several challenges, such as distribution discrepancies between different data sources (i.e., training vs testing). Optimisation of computational models is required to achieve higher performance of ACA classification in multiplex qPCR through the reduction of those discrepancies. Here, we proposed a novel transformer-based conditional domain adversarial network (T-CDAN) to eliminate data distribution differences between the source domain (synthetic DNA data) and the target domain (clinical isolate data). The labelled training data from the source domain and unlabelled testing data from the target domain are fed into the T-CDAN, which learns both domains' information simultaneously. After mapping the inputs into a domain-irrelevant space, T-CDAN removes the feature distribution differences and provides a clearer decision boundary for the classifier, resulting in a more accurate pathogen identification. Evaluation of 198 clinical isolates containing three types of carbapenem-resistant genes (blaNDM, blaIMP and blaOXA-48) illustrates a curve-level accuracy of 93.1% and a sample-level accuracy of 97.0% using T-CDAN, showing an accuracy improvement of 20.9% and 4.9% respectively. This research emphasises the importance of deep domain adaptation to enable high-level multiplexing in a single qPCR reaction, providing a solid approach to extend qPCR instruments' capabilities in real-world clinical applications.",2168-2208,,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3257727,"Imperial COVID-19 Research Fund(grant numbers:WDAI.G28059); Department of Health and Social Care funded Centre for Antimicrobial Optimisation (CAMO) at Imperial College London; Imperial College President's PhD Scholarships 2021; Scholarship from bioMerieux, S.A.; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070782,Domain adaptation;transformer;ACA;amplificaion curve analysis;PCR;multiplex,DNA;Feature extraction;Training;Multiplexing;Testing;Pathogens;Data models,Humans;Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction;Carbapenems,1.0,,38.0,CCBY,15 Mar 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
